    "CUDA has an execution model unlike the traditional sequential model used for programming CPUs. In CUDA, the code you write will be executed by multiple threads at once (often hundreds or thousands). Your solution will be modeled by defining a thread hierarchy of *grid*, *blocks* and *threads*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba’s CUDA support exposes facilities to declare and manage this hierarchy of threads. The facilities are largely similar to those exposed by NVidia’s CUDA C language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba also exposes three kinds of GPU memory: *global device memory* (the large, relatively slow off-chip memory that’s connected to the GPU itself), on-chip *shared memory* and *local memory*. For all but the simplest algorithms, it is important that you carefully consider how to use and access memory in order to minimize bandwidth requirements and contention."

    "\n",
    "A *kernel function* is a GPU function that is meant to be called from CPU code (*). It gives it two fundamental characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "kernels cannot explicitly return a value; all result data must be written to an array passed to the function (if computing a scalar, you will probably pass a one-element array);\n",
    "\n",
    "kernels explicitly declare their thread hierarchy when called: i.e. the number of thread blocks and the number of threads per block (note that while a kernel is compiled once, it can be called multiple times with different block sizes or grid sizes).\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, writing a CUDA kernel with Numba looks very much like writing a JIT function for the CPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "(*) Note: newer CUDA devices support device-side kernel launching; this feature is called dynamic parallelism but Numba does not support it currently)"
